## Usage Instructions

1. Replace all placeholders in square brackets `[placeholder]` with actual content
2. Remove sections that don't apply to your specific feature
3. Add additional sections as needed for your specific use case
4. Ensure all file paths and technical details are accurate per architecture.md
5. Update the file structure diagram to reflect your actual project structure from architecture.md
6. Verify all [Source: architecture.md#section] references are accurate
7. Complete Implementation Context section with patterns extracted from architecture.md
