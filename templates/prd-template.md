## 3. Features & Requirements

### User Stories / Epics

- "As a [user persona], I want to [action], so that [benefit]."
- "As a programmer learning a new language, I want to highlight a code block and ask for an explanation, so I can understand it better."
- "As a technical writer, I want the agent to fix grammar and spelling in my documentation, so I can write more effectively."
- "As an Emacs Lisp developer, I want the agent to correctly identify and explain complex macros, so that I can understand sophisticated codebases more quickly."
- "As an Emacs Lisp author, I want the agent to generate idiomatic code that correctly uses Emacs-specific functions and conventions."

### Epic: Core Agent Functionality

#### Story: Read Current Buffer

- [ ] Implement function to read content of active Emacs buffer (P0).
- [ ] Integrate with `M-x forj-prompt` to provide buffer content as context.

#### Story: Replace Region of Text

- [ ] Implement function to replace a specified region of text in an Emacs buffer (P0).
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of Emacs text properties and undo history.

#### Story: Take User Prompt

- [ ] Implement `M-x forj-prompt` to solicit user input in the minibuffer (P0).
- [ ] Capture and process the user's prompt for LLM interaction.

#### Story: Manage Conversation History

- [ ] Design data structure for storing conversation turns (user prompt, agent response) (P1).
- [ ] Implement functions to add to and retrieve from conversation history.
- [ ] Display conversation history in `*forj-conversation*` buffer.

### Epic: Shell Command Execution

#### Story: Execute Shell Commands

- [ ] Implement function to execute arbitrary shell commands (P1).
- [ ] Capture and display shell command output in a dedicated buffer.

### Epic: Contextual Understanding

#### Story: Read Multiple Files for Context

- [ ] Implement function to read content from multiple specified files (P2).
- [ ] Integrate multi-file content into the LLM's context for richer understanding.

### Epic: Non-Functional Requirements

#### Story: Secure API Key Storage

- [ ] Implement secure storage of LLM API keys using Emacs `auth-source` library.
- [ ] Ensure no API keys are stored in plain text.

#### Story: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Monitor LLM response times to ensure they are under 3 seconds for typical queries.
- [ ] Identify and address performance bottlenecks in data transfer or processing.

#### Story: Usability and Accessibility

- [ ] Ensure all agent interactions are keyboard-driven.
- [ ] Verify smooth integration with common Emacs workflows.

### Epic: Launch and Community Engagement

#### Story: Alpha Release

- [ ] Prepare a stable alpha release for a small group of Emacs community testers.
- [ ] Gather feedback and identify critical issues.

#### Story: Public Beta Release

- [ ] Prepare and release `Forj.el` on MELPA.
- [ ] Announce public beta to relevant Emacs communities.

#### Story: 1.0 Release Announcement

- [ ] Draft announcement for 1.0 release on r/emacs, r/lisp, Hacker News, and other relevant forums.
- [ ] Coordinate release timing with marketing efforts.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- **Performance:** Responses from the LLM should appear in under 3 seconds for typical queries.
- **Security:** API keys will be stored securely using the Emacs `auth-source` library. No keys will be stored in plain text.
- **Reliability / Availability:** The agent's availability is dependent on the uptime of the underlying LLM API.
- **Usability / Accessibility:** The agent must be usable entirely via the keyboard and should integrate smoothly with common Emacs workflows.

## 5. Constraints & Out of Scope

- **Assumptions:** Users have a stable internet connection and can acquire an API key for an LLM service.
- **Constraints / Dependencies:** The project is dependent on the availability and pricing of the chosen LLM API.
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Version 1.0 will not support voice input.
  - Version 1.0 will not have its own GUI.
  - Version 1.0 will only officially support the Gemini API.
