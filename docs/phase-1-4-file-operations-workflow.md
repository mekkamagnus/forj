(defun forj-build-project-context (&optional directory)
  "Build structured project context for DIRECTORY.
Returns plist with project type, files, dependencies, and summary.")
```

---

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Security Design Principles**
1. **Permission Validation**: Always check `file-readable-p` and `file-writable-p` before operations
2. **Path Sanitization**: Use `expand-file-name` and validate against directory traversal
3. **Backup Strategy**: Create timestamped backups before any modification
4. **Atomic Operations**: Write to temporary files, then rename to prevent corruption
5. **Validation Gates**: Mandatory `forj-paren-check` for all Emacs Lisp files
6. **User Confirmation**: Prompt for destructive operations with clear consequences

### **Data Structures**
```elisp
;; File metadata structure
(cl-defstruct forj-file-info
  path type size permissions last-modified readable writable encoding)

;; Project context structure  
(cl-defstruct forj-project-context
  root-directory type files summary dependencies ignore-patterns)

;; File operation result structure
(cl-defstruct forj-operation-result
  success error-message backup-path modified-time)
```

### **Integration Points**
- **Phase 1.3**: Display file operations in conversation buffer with activity tracking
- **Phase 1.2**: Use `forj-paren-check` for all Emacs Lisp validation
- **Future Phases**: Foundation for AI-directed file editing and multi-file operations
- **Conversation System**: Log all file operations with timestamps and summaries

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Lazy Loading**: Load file contents on demand, not during directory scanning
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache project context and file metadata with invalidation
- **Progress Feedback**: Show progress for operations taking >1 second
- **Memory Management**: Use streaming for large files, cleanup temporary data
- **Interruption Handling**: Allow user to cancel long-running operations

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Test Categories**
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function behavior and edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: File system interaction and conversation integration
3. **Security Tests**: Permission validation and path sanitization
4. **Performance Tests**: Large file and directory handling
5. **Error Recovery Tests**: Failure scenarios and rollback behavior

### **Test Data Setup**
```elisp
