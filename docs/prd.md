# Forj.el Product Requirements Document

## 1. Title and Metadata

- **Product/Feature Name:** `Forj.el`
- **Author(s):** Mekael
- **Status:** Draft
- **Last Updated:** September 1, 2025

## 2. Introduction & Vision

- **Problem Statement:** Emacs users, **especially those working with Emacs Lisp**, lack a deeply integrated, intelligent coding assistant. Current tools often fail to grasp the syntactic nuances and macro-heavy nature of Emacs Lisp, providing generic or incorrect suggestions. This forces developers to leave their highly-optimized editor for web-based tools that don't understand their workflow.
- **Vision / Goal:** Our vision is to forge an AI co-pilot that wields the full power of the Emacs environment and its introspective Lisp capabilities. It will go beyond simple text generation to become a natural extension of the user's thought process, offering deep, context-aware automation that makes development more productive and creative.
- **Target Audience / User Personas:** Experienced Emacs users, with a special focus on **Emacs Lisp developers**. Programmers who value keyboard-driven workflows and deep customizability will also feel at home.

## 3. Features & Requirements

### User Stories / Epics

- "As an Emacs developer, I want to ask the agent to refactor a complex function, so that I can improve code quality without manual effort."
- "As a programmer learning a new language, I want to highlight a code block and ask for an explanation, so I can understand it better."
- "As a technical writer, I want to ask the agent to fix grammar and spelling in my documentation, so I can write more effectively."
- "As an Emacs Lisp developer, I want the agent to correctly identify and explain complex macros, so that I can understand sophisticated codebases more quickly."
- "As an Emacs Lisp author, I want the agent to generate idiomatic code that correctly uses Emacs-specific functions and conventions."
